<p> Hi! Welcome to my website! In this website I will give you some of the basic projects I have worked on and what I enjoy doing in spare time. I am a student at Gems World Academy Chicago. Currently 14/2 and a freshman in highschool. I have a few projects that I did in my projects link above. Go check it out!
